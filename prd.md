GreenKudi: Waste-to-Energy & Rewards Platform

 Theme: Climate & Sustainability  Building for a Greener Future

1. Problem Statement

Urban areas in Nigeria and across Africa are overwhelmed with waste management challenges. Thousands of tons of solid waste are generated daily, but a large portion ends up in open dumps or waterways. This leads to:

Pollution and blocked drainage (increasing the risk of floods).

Greenhouse gas emissions from decomposing waste.

Missed opportunities for recycling and waste-to-energy conversion.

Low citizen participation due to lack of incentives.


Recycling and waste-to-energy facilities exist, but they remain underutilized because waste is not properly mapped, and citizens are not engaged in structured collection efforts.

2. The Proposed Solution: GreenKudi Platform

GreenKudi is a mobile and web-based platform that transforms waste management into an engaging, rewarding, and impactful community activity.

Key Features:

1. Waste Hotspot Mapping – Citizens can upload photos and locations of waste dumps. The app creates a live map of city waste hotspots.


2. Recycling & Energy Center Locator – Users can find the nearest recycling or waste-to-energy facilities with directions and details.


3. Gamified Reward System – Citizens earn points for reporting waste or dropping off recyclables. Points can be redeemed for airtime, mobile money, or vouchers.

4. Community & Government Dashboard – Provides real-time data to municipalities, NGOs, and recyclers for better planning and logistics.

3. Innovation & Uniqueness

Combines waste mapping and rewards in one seamless platform.

Leverages mobile money APIs and gamification to increase citizen participation.

Provides a data-driven approach for waste management decision-making.

Bridges environmental sustainability with economic empowerment (“Kudi” = money/value).

4. Implementation & Technology

Maps Integration: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap.

Rewards Integration: Mobile Money APIs (MTN MoMo, Flutterwave, Paystack).

AI Verification (future): Image recognition to confirm uploaded waste photos.

5. Expected Impact

Environmental: Cleaner cities, reduced pollution, and improved recycling rates.

Social: Encourages community involvement and builds awareness around waste management.

Economic: Creates micro-incentives for individuals and supports the circular economy.

Governmental: Provides actionable data for smarter city planning and waste collection.

6. Future Potential

Expansion to multiple cities and regional adoption.

Partnership with schools, communities, and NGOs for large-scale clean-up drives.

Integration of carbon credit tracking to attract climate financing.

Expansion of rewards into a green marketplace (eco-friendly products, transport discounts, etc.).

7. Conclusion

GreenKudi is more than a platform — it is a movement that transforms waste into opportunity. By combining technology, community action, and economic incentives, GreenKudi empowers citizens, supports government initiatives, and builds a greener, more sustainable future for Africa.
